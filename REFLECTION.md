Can I explain what my code does?

My code is creating my resume webpage by using HTML. I have used various tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>. Header contains my profile picture and navigation menu. Main tag contains different sections of about, education, skills, and experience. Footer contains the contact information and a decorative SVG.I have also added skip link for accessibility.

What was my coding process?

I started with updating my resume for reference to make webpage and then I planned what I need to add to it for personal touch. Nextly, I started by creating HTML document with HTML5 doctype declaration and than i built the structure by adding <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>. Then i started adding content and accessibility features. I made commits frequently by using meaningful messages. 

What challenges did I have?

- The most challenging part for me was to decide what SVG should i make and how to make it so i took help from the links provided in the Lab to create an SVG. 
- The other challenge that i faced was setting width and height for my profile picture because every time I added new width and height, my picture looked like it wasn't mine. But finally after trying for 6 to 7 times to set a perfect size, I got the perfect size. 

What would I do differently now?

If I start over this project again, i would do more search on creating SVG graphics to make the webpage more appealing.
